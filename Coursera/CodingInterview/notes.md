- `immutable` - cannot be changed after creation
- `linear data structures` - data elements are arranged in a linear sequence
    - `Array` - collection of elements identified by index or key
    - `Linked list` - collection of elements called nodes, each node has a reference to the next node in the sequence
    - `Stack` - collection of elements with two main operations: push and pop
    - `Queue` - collection of elements with two main operations: enqueue and dequeue
    - `Hash table` - collection of elements with key-value pairs
- `non-linear data structures` - data elements are not arranged in a sequence
    - `Tree` - collection of elements called nodes, each node has a reference to the next node in the sequence
    - `Graph` - collection of elements called nodes, each node has a reference to the next node in the sequence
- `abstract data types` - data types that are defined by the operations that can be performed on them
