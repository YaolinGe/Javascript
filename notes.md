# Notes for javascript

## Intro to javascript
- `<script src="/path/to/scripts.js"></script>` to add path to many javascripts files that are in a separate folder. 
- `src` is specified, then the script content is ignored. 
- `<script src="file.js"></script>
<script>
  alert(1);
</script>` to show two different ways of adding javascript to a page.
- `use strict` should be on the top of the file. 
- `use strict` is a directive that indicates that the code should be executed in "strict mode", thus only modern style is allowed. 
- `camelCase` for constants which are not known prior the execution. 
- `CAPITAL_LETTERS` for constants which are known prior the execution. Hard-coded values.
